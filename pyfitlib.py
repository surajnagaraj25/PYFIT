ectdiet = "ECTOMORPH DIET:\n\
\n\
1. Eat surplus calories- intake more calories than you burn each day!\n\
2. Eat calorie dense foods like fatty meat, rice and bread.\n\
3. Cut down on food with low calorie density like oats. These tend to make you feel full and prevent you from eating more frequently, which brings us to the next point.\
4. Eat more frequently. Three meals a day will not cut it for an ectomorph. Three major meals a day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) along with three lighter meals in between will ease the process of weight gain and ensure high energy levels throughout the day.\n\
5. Consume more protein in the form of meat, eggs, fish and protein shakes."

Meal 1 – Breakfast Shake\n\
1 scoop whey isolate\n\
1 cup whole milk\n\

enddiet = "ENDOMORPH DIET:\n\
\n\
1. Cut down on carbs- things like white rice, white bread, pasta and sugary sweets.\n\
2. Cut down on calories but don’t go crazy! You will see good results initially, but after a while your body stops responding to the calorie deficiency. You will eventually start binge eating and go back to square one.\n\
3. Eat foods that will fill you up with less calorie intake, like Oats. This is the opposite of what is recommended to ectomorphs.\n\
4. Increase the intake of protein through lean meats, eggs(whites only) and protein shakes.\n\
5. Consume more meals a day, but in lesser portions. Like six small meals a day instead of three large ones."

1. Mesomorphs are relatively lucky. They do not have a follow a strict diet like eco or endomorphs but avoid junk and unhealthy food as much as possible.\n\
2. Diet should comprise of around 40% of complex carbohydrates which includes wheat breads, brown rice, quinoa, potatoes, legumes, etc.\n\
3. Lean protein content in the diet must be around 30%. Consume food items like seafood, soy, poultry, egg whites, lean beef, etc.\n\
4. The remaining 30% of the diet must include healthy fats like nuts, avocado, cheese, whole eggs, etc.\n\
5. Do not get overconfident because of the fact that you are a mesomorph, as it is easy to slip into either of the other body types if a proper diet and workout is not maintained."

1. The foundation of ectomorph training should aim to improve testosterone (your muscle building hormone) production.\n\
2. Compound multi-jointed exercises (such as squats, deadlifts, bench presses) in a workout that lasts no more than 55 minutes is the best strategy for maximizing testosterone and muscle building.\n\

1. The focus should be on burning fat through a combination of cardio AND weight training.\n\
2. Interval-based conditioning, utilizing exercises that tax the entire body (sprints, box jumps and sled pushes, etc), will help you strip away body fat.\n\
3. The goal is to get your body burning as much fuel as possible during your training sessions and to continue maximizing that calorie burn long after you've finished.\n\
4. When you're not working out, aim to be active. Opt for walks, yoga, bike rides–anything to get your body moving and burning calories."
